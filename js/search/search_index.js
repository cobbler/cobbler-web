Follow this guide or use your package manager to install it.\nnode: Use this download link or use your package manager to install it.\nnpm: Should be bundled along with node.\nangular/cli: Use this link to install it.\n\nBasic setup\n\nPlease ensure that if you are on Windows that you have set the git setting core.autocrlf to false and core.eol to lf!\n\nThis will give you a setup of both repositories of the main Git branches.\n\nClone Cobbler: git clone git@github.com:cobbler/cobbler.git\nClone Cobbler Web: git clone git@github.com:cobbler/cobbler-web.git\nGo into the cobbler directory and execute the following steps:\nBuild the Docker image: docker build -f docker/develop/develop.dockerfile -t cobbler-dev .\nRun the built image: docker run -it --rm --name cobbler-dev -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v ${PWD}:/code cobbler-dev\nExecute the setup script in the running container: ./docker/develop/scripts/setup-supervisor.sh\nLet the container run in the foreground! You may want to tail the Cobbler log:\ntail -f /var/log/cobbler/cobbler.log\n\n\nGo into the cobbler-web directory and follow these steps:\nRun an npm install to install the development and runtime dependencies.\nBuild the TS-XMLRPC API via: npm run build typescript-xmlrpc\nBuild the Cobbler-API project via: npm run build cobbler-api\nServe the Cobbler frontend via: npm run start cobbler-frontend\n\n\nGo to http://localhost:4200 to see the frontend.\nLogin is:\nUsername: cobbler\nPassword: cobbler\n\n\n\nAdvanced setup\nWhen developing the Web Frontend it is needed sometimes to switch between different release codestreams. In the following, a few examples of the current codestreams can be seen:\nMain\n\nThis assumes that you are in the root folder of the backend repository.\n\nExample :git checkout main\ndocker build -f docker/develop/develop.dockerfile -t cobbler-dev .\ndocker run -it --rm --name cobbler-dev -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v ${PWD}:/code cobbler-dev\nmake clean\n./docker/develop/scripts/setup-supervisor.shrelease33\n\nThis assumes that you are in the root folder of the backend repository.\n\nExample :git checkout release33\ndocker build -f docker/develop/develop.dockerfile -t cobbler-dev:release33 .\ndocker run -it --rm --name cobbler-dev -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v ${PWD}:/code cobbler-dev:release33\nmake clean\n./docker/develop/scripts/setup-supervisor.shError handling\nCORS\nWhen you are running Angular applications this is a common issue. Please check the following things:\n\nif the request is blocked by the browser or the server (so Cobbler).\nif the request is lacking the required headers, check the Apache webserver configuration in the Cobbler testing\ncontainer at /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/cobbler.conf\nif the request is resulting in a 404, check the proxy.conf.json for the correct URL.\n\nWe will only be guiding you as a developer very limited here as this is a very environment specific setting. Most of the\ntime will be \"Here is a random Stackoverflow link, please read and debug yourself.\".\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/deployment.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/deployment.html","title":"additional-page - Deployment","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeployment\nThere are at the moment no configuration files that can be edited.\nBare-Metal\nTBD\nDocker / Podman\nWith Docker:\nExample :docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/cobbler/cobbler-web:mainWith Podman:\nExample :podman run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/cobbler/cobbler-web:mainHelm Chart\nTBD\nCommon issues\nCORS\nIn a production environment this should not be an issue as the Cobbler backend is supposed to have the header\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin=*. Please verify if this header is present if you encounter issues.\nThe issue of CORS cannot be solved inside the Web UI,\nas such each administrator must debug and fix these issues for their own setup.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
