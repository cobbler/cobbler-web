developer: @nelliesnoodles & @SchoolGuy\n@ https://github.com/nelliesnoodles/Angular-CBBLR\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js and npm\ninstall Node.js dependencies with npm install\nbuild required projects\n\nExample :npm run build typescript-xmlrpc\nnpm run build cobbler-apiDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change\nany of the source files.\nNote: Since this is a multi-project repo you need to add the project name. The only project which is a frontend is\ncurrently cobbler-frontend though. Serving will only work if you have built our two libraries as described above.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name --project projectName to generate a new component. You can also use\nng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod\nflag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the\nAngular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 Cobbler Project cobbler.project@gmail.com\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Follow this guide or use your package manager to install it.\nnode: Use this download link or use your package manager to install it.\nnpm: Should be bundled along with node.\nangular/cli: Use this link to install it.\n\nBasic setup\n\nPlease ensure that if you are on Windows that you have set the git setting core.autocrlf to false and core.eol to lf!\n\nThis will give you a setup of both repositories of the main Git branches.\n\nClone Cobbler: git clone git@github.com:cobbler/cobbler.git\nClone Cobbler Web: git clone git@github.com:cobbler/cobbler-web.git\nGo into the cobbler directory and execute the following steps:\nBuild the Docker image: docker build -f docker/develop/develop.dockerfile -t cobbler-dev .\nRun the built image: docker run -it --rm --name cobbler-dev -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v ${PWD}:/code cobbler-dev\nExecute the setup script in the running container: ./docker/develop/scripts/setup-supervisor.sh\nLet the container run in the foreground! You may want to tail the Cobbler log:\ntail -f /var/log/cobbler/cobbler.log\n\n\nGo into the cobbler-web directory and follow these steps:\nRun an npm install to install the development and runtime dependencies.\nBuild the TS-XMLRPC API via: npm run build typescript-xmlrpc\nBuild the Cobbler-API project via: npm run build cobbler-api\nServe the Cobbler frontend via: npm run start cobbler-frontend\n\n\nGo to http://localhost:4200 to see the frontend.\nLogin is:\nUsername: cobbler\nPassword: cobbler\n\n\n\nAdvanced setup\nWhen developing the Web Frontend it is needed sometimes to switch between different release codestreams. In the following, a few examples of the current codestreams can be seen:\nMain\n\nThis assumes that you are in the root folder of the backend repository.\n\nExample :git checkout main\ndocker build -f docker/develop/develop.dockerfile -t cobbler-dev .\ndocker run -it --rm --name cobbler-dev -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v ${PWD}:/code cobbler-dev\nmake clean\n./docker/develop/scripts/setup-supervisor.shrelease33\n\nThis assumes that you are in the root folder of the backend repository.\n\nExample :git checkout release33\ndocker build -f docker/develop/develop.dockerfile -t cobbler-dev:release33 .\ndocker run -it --rm --name cobbler-dev -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v ${PWD}:/code cobbler-dev:release33\nmake clean\n./docker/develop/scripts/setup-supervisor.shError handling\nCORS\nWhen you are running Angular applications this is a common issue. Please check the following things:\n\nif the request is blocked by the browser or the server (so Cobbler).\nif the request is lacking the required headers, check the Apache webserver configuration in the Cobbler testing\ncontainer at /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/cobbler.conf\nif the request is resulting in a 404, check the proxy.conf.json for the correct URL.\n\nWe will only be guiding you as a developer very limited here as this is a very environment specific setting. Most of the\ntime will be \"Here is a random Stackoverflow link, please read and debug yourself.\".\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
